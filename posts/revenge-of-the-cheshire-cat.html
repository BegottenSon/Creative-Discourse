    <h1 class="blogPostHeadline">Revenge of the Cheshire Cat</h1>
      <p class="blogPara">
        In July of 2019, Dreamville released Revenge of the Dreamers 3, along with it, he released footage of the collaborative effort. 
        At that moment I knew that is how I wanted to do all my collaborations but I was held back by the belief that I needed to reach the status of a J. Cole to make that happen. 
        Little did I know, that day a seed was planted that would eventually turn into Creative Discourse.
      </p>
      <p class="blogPara">
        The beauty of having partners is they will often pull things out of you that you put on the back burner. 
        Almost a year after my creative collaboration thought came and went, Daniel called and began to excitedly explain his idea that came to him while watching "We Are the World" footage. 
        After hearing the idea, a Cheshire cat like smile spread across my face because I had recently seen "We Are the World" footage and wanted to do something like it but was unsure how. 
        Once Daniel made it all make sense, I was all in.
      </p>
      <p class="blogPara">
        The ultimate goal was to bring creatives together and simply create with no rules. Once the session was booked, I decided two things. 
        1. To reach out to people I thought would be a great fit and get them on board. 2. 
        I decided that although I have verses and hooks for days (because I have more written songs than I could ever record) I would go into each session with a blank slate. 
        Everything must be created there. I figured this would motivate those around me to be creative as well as put me under the gun to deliver. 
        Because it would be easy for me to record 4 to 5 entire prewritten songs without feeling out the vibe of the group.
      </p>
      <p class="blogPara">
        Excited and unsure of how this first session would go, I showed up about 45 minutes early with my crew. And as great as I planned it out in mind, the actual experience was much better. 
        Every person in the room adding something, even if it's just a suggestion on how something should be said. I did a song with my son without it being the forced, father/son track. 
        I also collaborated with folk who I probably wouldn't have crossed paths with and we made magic. Being able to freely write, record, mentor, produce and even just listen and soak up dope music was wonderful.
      </p>
      <p class="blogPara">
        I am of the strong belief that artists are weirdos which makes it hard for artists to fit in. 
        Although we build our brands on standing out, sometimes it's great to find a place for all the weirdos to go and feel like we are a part of the collective. 
        And this is exactly what happens at Creative Discourse, each session is great and the following session will prove to always be better than the last.
